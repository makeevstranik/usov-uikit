### Contacts ###
App for saving contacts (title and phone), it's possible to create or change a contact or delete it. 

Using: 
- User Defaults - (save *struct with self-made coding/decoding to appropriate UD type 
  + üñï DON'T DO THAT, as UD only for simple types and data)
  + üñï Pay attention: There is far more simple way to code/decode *struct* (conform protcol *Codable*) but it doesn't work with *protocol* only for library      types
  
    [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50346052/protocol-extending-encodable-or-codable-does-not-conform-to-it#fromHistory)
    [and here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46337380/conforming-class-to-codable-protocol-in-swift4)
   
- Table View - (reusable cell)
- ToolBar - (add new item)
- Polimorfism with *prortocols*
- Swipe in cell - (*trailingSwipeActionsConfigurationForRowAt* call Alert) 
- Alert - the same allert for adding and changing contacts
